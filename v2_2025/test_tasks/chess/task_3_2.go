	//How would I compare two interfaces?

	// If the interface contains a comparable value, I would use a simple comparison (==).
	// If the interface contains a non-comparable value, I would use the reflect package with the DeepEqual function for comparison.
	// Essentially, it's the same approach as we use for structs.
